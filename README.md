The Responses.txt file is required for the command to run.

Open CMD and open the directory of the folder (e.g. cd C:\Users\NAME\m8bp2) Once in the directory you must first compile it before you run the script.

Once in the directory, run this command to compile it: javac m8bp2.java

This will create a file in your directory named "m8bp2.class"

Once this file is created, you can now run the Magic 8 Ball using this command: java m8bp2

Ask it anything you would like and it will answer, you can also change the responses that the 8 ball gives by changing the text in the "responses.txt" file.
